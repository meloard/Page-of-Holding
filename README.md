# Page-of-Holding
Project 2 Due Nov 1

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

In order to full understand a full stack build, we attempted to create a character generator, by first building a server and then connecting that server to the front end through the MVC model. 

Page of holding is a character creator app that allows a user to create a unique Dungeons & Dragons character, and then stores the built character in a users account. The premise of the app allows a user to create a character and then to pull the data for the character to then play in their local dungeons & dragons game!


## Installation

NPM packages, dotenv + mysql login
